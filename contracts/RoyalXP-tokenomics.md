The final configuration of the **RoyalXP** (v.1.0) royalty token will work as follows: 
1. “*Originals*” (Gen 0 NFTs - Templates) **XP Cards** are minted as NFTs by an *Original* Guest (initial creator) on the Ethereum Blockchain.

2. “*Derivatives*” (Gen 1, …, Gen N NFTs) **XP Cards** are based on *Originals*, and are directly “bridged” and minted as NFTs on Matic, with lower transaction fees. 

3. Any time a new **Derivative XP Card** is *bridged* and *minted*, the *Original Guest* (XP Designer) receives an amount of royalties in **RoyalXP** tokens. 

4. RoyalXPs have __no cap__, and __no initial supply__. It's a “mine-able” (*inflationary*) ERC20-like token – generated in base of the duration of the *Derivative XP Card* (either 2, 5, or 10 minute **events**). 

5. Based on what mentioned above, Original Guest may receive either 2, 5, or 10 RoyalXPs **any time their Template is used**. 

6. RoyalXPs will be used to (i.) **tip Hosts** during the livestreaming event – and for other meaningful actions such as (ii.) exchanging them **for other NFTs**, or (iii.) **propose to “Join”** a 1-to-1 event. 

7. **RoyalXP is the first Royalty+Reputation Token (and use-case) associated to live events.**
